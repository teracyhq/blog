"Open" is one of Teracy's most important values. We promote open source projects on our
development path.

For open source projects, we have open source licenses. For other "creative" resources such as
our blog posts and documentation, `Creative Commons`[^1] license is used.

<!-- more -->

To choose[^2] and add `Creative Commons` license to `octopress`[^3] posts easily, we created
[octopress-cc-license][] plugin. This is the first release milestone as of v0.1.0 with "basic
configuration for cc license allow modification, allow commercial uses and icon styles."

What's next? For v0.2.0 release, we would like to support:

- cc_license_license_jurisdiction
- cc-license chooser for individual posts
- use tag plugin instead of template

For details, please head to: https://github.com/hoatle/octopress-cc-license/issues?milestone=2

We hope that this plugin is helpful for your `octopress` blog posts. Happy blogging!
