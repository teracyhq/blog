At Teracy, development tools and development management are very important for us to keep and work
in a consistent workflow manner. There are rules, however, the rules should be guided, checked
and forced so that everyone could understand and work together more effectively. After a few days of
setting up, we're very happy to introduce our development tools.

<!-- more -->

As we know, a development team should (at least) have:

+ issues management
+ source code management
+ wiki management

Well, if your team is small, `github`[^1] is good enough. However, if you have many repositories,
issue management could be hard. Moreover, the workflow and issues management on `github` is
just very simple.

At Teracy, we need more than that. We need a better workflow, we need consistent development tools
that have good and seamlessly integration and `Atlassian`[^2]'s products meets our requirements.

Many thanks to `Atlassian` for supporting open source projects, we could get open source licenses
for all our development tools for free:

`Jira`[^3] instance for issues management is at: https://issues.teracy.org

`Stash`[^4] instance for source code management is at: https://code.teracy.org

Note that we're still using `github` for our open source projects to get more contribution
easily, thank you `github` :). There is no reason why we should not use both `github` and `Jira`.

`Confluence`[^5] instance for wiki management is at: https://wiki.teracy.org

It took us just a few days to setup all these instances.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank you very much, `GlobalSign`[^6], too, for approving
our open source SSL certificate application.

We're still migrating issues from `github` to http://issues.teracy.org and there are still many
steps ahead to setup a good development environment.

Thanks for reading our news, have a nice weekend and and happy playing!
