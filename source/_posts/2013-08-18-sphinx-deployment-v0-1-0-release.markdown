10 days after the announcement of `sphinx-deployment`[^1] project, today we're very happy to
announce v0.1.0 release.

<!-- more -->

This is just a small release milestone, it fully supports `Github Pages`[^2] deployment. It's stable
enough to use now.

The next step we will support `Rsync`[^3] deployment with v0.2.0 release.

Now it's really easy to deploy your `sphinx` docs to `Github Pages` with `sphinx-deployment`, grab
it now at https://github.com/teracy-official/sphinx-deployment

Have a nice day and happy hacking!
