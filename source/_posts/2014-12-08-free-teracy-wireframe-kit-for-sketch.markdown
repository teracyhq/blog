It’s always a good idea to begin with a wireframe when beginning a new web design or mobile app project. 
Wireframes can be a big time saver as they help both designers and developers come to an agreement on placement 
of major UI elements. The key is to get the layout nailed down so you don't have to change major layout when 
 detailed design elements are in place.

In our design process at Teracy, wireframing and mockups takes an important position. We have developed 
a wireframe kit to speedup the design process and use it in our daily design workflow. Today, we are excited
 to share the version of our wireframe kit that we are using, which includes the most common UI elements
in web projects. This is the second UI kit we share to [Sketch][] community, you can also check out our first freebie [Bootflat UI kit for Sketch][] shared not a long time ago. 

Here it is, hope it's useful for all Sketch lovers!
